## Lapix Ajax Modue

- Better way to handle headers; set per request or globally

I'm thinking of moving towards jQuery; global ajax settings, then a set of args that can be set then some helper methods that make it easier.

I should use events rather than callbacks. This also allows for a global Ajax listener.
